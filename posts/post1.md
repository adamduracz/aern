AERN has been slowly settling on GitHub.  Today, these pages have been added as a part of this process.
The pages are built using Hakyll and Bootstrap.

The following is planned to be added soon:
 
  * Goals and road map
  * Tutorials
  * Reference help pages
  * Explanations of some AERN algorithms
  * Related publications
