What should be in C:

* polynomial type transparent to Haskell

* operations exposed to Haskell:
  * rounded field ops for polynomials
  * eval at a point using given +,* and coeff conversion
  * (?) rounded partial eval of polynomials 

Values provided by Haskell as StablePtrs:
  * coefficients
  * effort indicators

Operations provided by Haskell as a struct of StablePtrs:
  * rounded field arithmetic for coefficients
  * coefficients zero and one 
  * coefficient partial comparison
  
Haskell functions exposed to C:
  * evaluator of Haskell unary and binary operations 
    passed together with their parameters from C using StablePtrs
