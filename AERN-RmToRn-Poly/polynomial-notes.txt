What should be in C:

* polynomial type transparent to Haskell

* operations exposed to Haskell:
  * creation of constant and projection polynomials
  * rounded + for centered polynomial enclosures
  * rounded (d +) for centered polynomial enclosures
  * rounded (d *) for centered polynomial enclosures
  * rounded * for centered polynomial enclosures in power basis
  * rounded * for centered polynomial enclosures in Chebyshev basis
  * eval at a point using given +,*,1 and coeff conversion
  * substitution of polynomials inside polynomials (for splitting and merging)
  

Values provided by Haskell as StablePtrs:
  * coefficients
  ops:
  * rounded field arithmetic for coefficients
  * coefficients zero and one 
  * coefficient partial comparison
  
Haskell functions exposed to C:
  * evaluator of Haskell unary and binary operations 
    passed together with their parameters from C using StablePtrs
